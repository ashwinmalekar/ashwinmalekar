A **Data Scientist with 2 YoE**. Having worked around 2 years as a Data Science Intern/Software Engineer at 2 AI startups, taking features that make a business impact, from concept to the production environment, I'm proficient in Python, SQL, Microsoft Azure, TypeScript, Angular

Where does my AI/ML expertise come from? 
I've acheived a M.Sc. in Data Science with **Distinction** from the University of Birmingham, where I designed an advanced recommendation model using deep learning techniques that enhance the personalisation of recommendations in the model inference, improving the hit rate by 20%. During this, I explored various recommendation algorithms & was able to outperform traditionally used methods.
