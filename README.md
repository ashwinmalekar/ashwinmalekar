## Hello!

## About Me

A **Software Developer with AI/ML expertise**. Having worked around 2 years as a Software Developer at 2 AI startups, taking features that make a business impact, from concept to the production environment, I'm proficient in TypeScript, Python, Angular, REST APIs & Microsoft Azure. 

Where does my AI/ML expertise come from? 
I've acheived a M.Sc. in Data Science with **Distinction** from the University of Birmingham, where I designed an advanced recommendation model using deep learning techniques that enhance the personalisation of recommendations in the model inference, improving the hit rate by 20%. During this, I explored various recommendation algorithms & was able to outperform traditionally used methods. 

I also interned at a startup as a AI Developer where I worked on a recommendation engine for a telecom client that recommends better mobile/broadband deals to their customers, to improve performance or cost-cutting. I led the development of the recommendation model using unsupervised techniques, best ML practices.

*I'm actively looking for opportunities where I can apply my unique skillset that includes frontend development(Angular), Backend Development(Python - Flask/FastAPI) & AI/ML(NLP) expertise.*
